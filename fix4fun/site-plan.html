        In our main section, we will give people the opportunity to know more about what software and hardware are. And to explain this, we think that the best way to make the website easier for everyone is by adding images that will give people an easy way to understand where they are.

We have a hardware section and a software section, we have the videos section and the personal assistance section. In every one, you will find some tools that will help you.
        Software
        The software includes all the computer programs that make it possible to execute specific tasks within a computer. It is all the intangible parts of the computer. For example, operating systems, applications, web browsers, games, or programs.
        Hardware
        Hardware represents the physical and tangible components of a computer that is, the components that can be seen and touched. Hardware examples are the following: Mouse, keyboard, CPU, graphic card, motherboard, etc.
        hardware and Software
        These features always work hand in hand. While the software provides the operations, the hardware is the physical channel through which those functions can be performed.

      <h3>Learn With Videos</h3>
      <p>
        We also believe that every person can learn how to use and fix a computer. That is the main reason that we provide some external videos that can bring you a simple solution that can help you to save some money and learn something new, like restore a machine or maybe how to install basic programs on your computer. We will have 3 different videos. The first one will show people how to reset a computer step by step. The second video will show people how to install Microsoft Package (Excel, Powerpoint, Word, etc). And the third video will teach people how to update computer drivers and a simple explanation of what drivers are.
Reset a Computer
Resetting a computer refers to restarting it, and returning to the initial state of the system that was affected by some type of error. On the other hand, Formatting means DELETING EVERYTHING that is inside the storage of the equipment.
Microsoft Package
Microsoft Office is an office software package. It is a set of applications that carry out office automation tasks, that is, that help us to automate and perfect the usual activities of an office. It is so useful for students.
Updating Drivers
A driver is software that controls a device on a PC; for example, a video or sound card. Controllers act as "bridges" between applications and devices, making sure that the two interact. If you are experiencing graphics or sound corruption issues, your drivers most likely need an update.
