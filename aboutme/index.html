    <p>Hi everyone, I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I served a full-time mission on the Brazil Fortaleza East mission. I'm engaged with a very special girl called Karen that I really love. And currently, I'm living with my parents. Last year I was living in Utah with my sister's family so I really improved my English skills</p>
    <p>I'm 23 years old and love to travel, and know new places and people. That is why I like to learn new languages. I speak Spanish, Portuguese, and English. I like to play any kind of sports and play video games. Currently, I work 9 hours per day at an insurance office and I want to work as a front-end developer! Last year I had a lot of trouble taking my classes because of my work and personal things, but this year I will do it better. And I really love to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</p>

    <p>I'm very excited to learn with you guys, nice to meet you!</p>
